# Frontend Performance Tracing

## Audience

Software Developers who build frontend in complex landscapes, especially the ones facing performance issues.

## Pitch

Web and Native Applications are expected to be fast; no one likes waiting.
As every user interacts differently with your application it is next to impossible to understand the performance characteristics and therefore the waiting times by testing your application by hand.
This becomes increasingly difficult when the number of features in your app and the amount of different devices goes up.

What gets measured gets managed, thats why I want to give you an introduction on performance tracing tools usable in the frontend.
I want to show you how to add tracing to your React (Native) App and how to integrate your backend systems, sothat you can see why certain requests take the time they need.
Hopefully this will inspire you to add tracing to your application, you might see opportunities to optimize that would otherwise have stayed hidden and you can quantify on how much your optimization helped.
